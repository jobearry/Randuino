# Hybrid Wheelchair Carrier (Control System)

This project is developed for my thesis during college and the goal is to create a control system for a hybrid wheelchair carrier to enable disabled people drive alongside the road despite their differences. During the planning phase of this project, there are ideas that did not make it on the final product due to expense problems, but despite that, me and my groupmates have somehow carried on.
